## Demo/Paper result reproduction
Navigate to the ```constrained_bo_scripts``` folder and run ```bash optimize_gramnegative_only.sh``` for an example of optimizing template 8 ("GHLLIHLIGKATLAL") for gramnegative bacteria only, with a similarity of at least 75% to the template, and producing 20 different optimized peptides at the end. Set the constraint_types argument to the desired seed peptide for optimization. Each optimization run stops making progress after around 20-30 hours, and can be terminated safely using ```Ctrl + C```, all results will be uploaded to wandb in real time.

You should replace YOUR_WANDB_ENTITY with your wandb user id (free to use), the logs will be automatically uploaded to wandb and also saved locally in ```APEXGo/optimization/constrained_bo_scripts/optimization_all_collected_data```. The final diverse set of peptides produced can be found in the summary metrics of wandb logs as diverse_set_X1 ~ X20 and the corresponding APEX oracle scores are diverse_set_Y1 ~ Y20.
